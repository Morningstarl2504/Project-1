==============================

Here's a summary of the email:

*   **Project Phoenix Status (Nov 6th):**
    *   **Image Processing Tool:** Complete and working well (resizing, 'enhance' filter).
    *   **Document Conversion:** **BLOCKER:** `cloudconvert` API authentication failing. The `CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY` from `.env` is not being loaded by `mcp_server.py`.
    *   **News Monitoring Tool:** Experiencing a SQL error ("ON CONFLICT clause does not match..."). Requires deleting `mcp_server.db` and allowing `init_database` to recreate it.
*   **Urgent Action Item:**
    *   **Utkarsh:** Debug the `CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY` loading issue in `mcp_server.py`, ensuring `load_dotenv()` is called correctly before `DocumentProcessor` initialization. This is the top priority.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Team sync-up scheduled for 3:00 PM today to resolve the two identified blockers.
