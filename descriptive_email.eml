Hi Team,

Here is our status update for "Project Phoenix" as of Thursday, November 6th.

1.  **Image Processing Tool:**
    The `process_image` tool is complete and working well. The new features for resizing and applying the 'enhance' filter passed all tests. Great work, everyone.

2.  **Document Conversion - BLOCKER:**
    We've hit a significant issue with the document conversion tool. The old method that relied on `pypandoc` and `wkhtmltopdf` was causing the server to time out. We've replaced this with the new `cloudconvert` API, but I'm still seeing authentication failures.
    
    I have added my API key to the `.env` file, but the server logs suggest it's still not being picked up correctly. The conversion attempts are failing before they even reach the CloudConvert dashboard. We need to debug why the `mcp_server.py` process isn't loading the `CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY` from the `.env` file.

3.  **Action Item (Urgent):**
    Utkarsh, can you please take the lead on debugging the environment variable issue? Let's double-check that `load_dotenv()` is being called correctly in `mcp_server.py` *before* the `DocumentProcessor` class is initialized. This is our top priority.

4.  **News Monitoring:**
    The `get_trending_topics` tool is also showing a SQL error: "ON CONFLICT clause does not match...". This looks like a database schema issue. We need to delete the `mcp_server.db` file and let the server's `init_database` function create a new, correct one.

Let's sync up at 3:00 PM today to get these two blockers resolved.

Thanks,
Maria
